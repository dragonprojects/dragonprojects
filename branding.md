# Branding

## Logos

Dragon Projects and its services use a multitude of logos as a means of representing themselves. With a few exceptions, they typically consist of two parts:

* “Dragon” branding (this would be the “Dragon” part in “Dragon Projects”, for example)
* Service name (this would be the “Projects” part in “Dragon Projects”, for example)

With this two-part logo, there are a multitude of logo options available.

### Coloured logo
This type of logo consists of a black or white “Dragon” branding, followed by a colour-coded service name. What this particular colour should be, is described in the colour palette section of this document. You are not allowed to change this colour or shift its hue.

Correct: Dragon Projects (the service name is using its associated brand colour)
Incorrect: Dragon Projects (the service name is not using its associated brand colour)
Incorrect: Dragon Projects (poor contrast compared to a monochromatic logo)

If you suffer from a colour vision deficiency, we highly recommend you to use a digital colour meter to check whether the colour code of the service matches with the colour of the service name in the logo.

### Monochromatic logo
The full two-part logo is black, white or a shade of grey. Always pick the logo that creates the most contrast with the background you are using. This means that you should opt for a black (#000000) or white (#FFFFFF) logo, for they create more contrast than a grey logo.

Correct: Dragon Projects (a lot of contrast and very easy to read)
OK: Dragon Projects (legible, but a black logo could make it easier to read)
Incorrect: Dragon Projects (very poor contrast, hard to read, fails WCAG AA criteria)
Incorrect: Dragon Projects (not black, white or a shade of grey)

### Standalone logo
A standalone logo is usually a square or a round glyph image and only a handful of Dragon Projects’ services have one. This logo is used when using a wide logo containing text is not ideal and needs to be truncated into a small square or circle. These logos come as-is and may not be altered in any way, shape or form. Wherever sensible, use the coloured or monochromatic logo instead.

## Colour palette

## Fonts
Dragon Projects uses [LEMON MILK Pro FTR](https://marsnev.com/?product=lemon-milk-pro-ftr) for most texts on the web. It may adapt its font to blend in with the ecosystem of different platforms like iOS and Android.

## Referencing

The correct way to reference to Dragon Projects is to use title case, writing the first letter of each word the name consists with a capital letter. A less-preferred, albeit still accepted way of referencing Dragon Projects is by writing it in all caps.

Correct: Dragon Projects (this is the preferred way of referencing Dragon Projects)
OK: DRAGON PROJECTS (this is the alternate way of referencing Dragon Projects)
Incorrect: DragonProjects (a space between the two words needs to be inserted)
Incorrect: dragon projects (the first letter of both words need to be capitalised)
Incorrect: DRAGON Projects (use either title case or all caps for the full name)

These referencing rules also apply to the names of Dragon Projects’ services.
