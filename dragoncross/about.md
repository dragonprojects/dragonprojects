# Dragon Cross
Dragon Cross is a service utilising [Matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge) to bridge multiple messaging servicves together. This means several users can use different platforms, yet still communicate to each other. Currently, we support the following services:

- [Discord](https://discord.com)
- [Telegram](https://telegram.org)

In order to use Dragon Cross, you need to be invited. There is currently no way for new users to request an invite. For more information on the set of features that are supported across platforms, visit the [Matterbridge wiki](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki).
