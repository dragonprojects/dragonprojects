# Bedrock Edition
Bedrock Edition refers to the multi-platform family of editions of Minecraft, which includes all currently supported editions except Java Edition. Previously, before the Better Together update, Bedrock Edition is also still sometimes referred to as "Pocket Edition", "MCPE", or "Pocket/Windows 10 Edition".

> This edition of Minecraft officially supports mobile devices and virtual reality headsets.

## Joining using GeyserMC
Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers. It allows Bedrock Edition players to join Java Edition servers by translating all the incoming and outgoing packets. This can be used to join the vanilla Java Edition Dragon Craft server at `vanilla.craft.dragonprojects.net`.

To get information on how to setup GeyserMC, [visit their wiki](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/wiki#Setup). You will need to use the Standalone Setup for Dragon Craft.

## Joining the dedicated server
We also have a dedicated server specifically for Bedrock Edition players available. Use the following address in your Minecraft client: `bedrock.craft.dragonprojects.net`.

> This flavour of Dragon Craft is experimental and may be unstable.
