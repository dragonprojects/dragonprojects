## Installation

### Technic

{.is-success}

>  Do not migrate your Minecraft or Mojang account to Microsoft. Third-party launchers currently do not have support for these accounts.
{.is-danger}
1. [Download Java from Oracle](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and install it.
>  Windows users must make sure that they are installing the 64-bit version of Java, else performance will be significantly diminished. If the download page does not explicitly state it's 64-bit, you are likely downloading the 32-bit version.
{.is-warning}
2. [Download the Technic Launcher](https://www.technicpack.net/download) from Technic's website. Run it afterwards and run it with Java afterwards to install it.
4. After installation, open up the Technic Launcher. Navigate to your modpack list and paste the following into the search bar: `http://api.technicpack.net/modpack/dragon-craft-modpack`.
5. Install the modpack that now shows up.
6. Go to the Dragon Craft modpack's settings and give Java at least 3 GB of RAM. This is needed to run the game smoothly.
7. Launch and enjoy!

### MultiMC
>  Do not migrate your Minecraft or Mojang account to Microsoft. Third-party launchers currently do not have support for these accounts.
{.is-danger}

>  Windows users must make sure that they are installing the 64-bit version of Java, else performance will be significantly diminished. If the download page does not explicitly state it's 64-bit, you are likely downloading the 32-bit version.
{.is-warning}
2. [Download MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) from MultiMC's website. Run the executable and set it up.
4. After installation, create a new Minecraft 1.12.2 instance and install Forge version 14.23.5.2854.
5. Open the instance's folder. [Download the latest version of the modpack](https://github.com/dragonprojects/dragoncraft/releases/latest/download/modpack.zip) and extract the contents to this folder.

### Manual

{.is-info}
1. [Download Java from Oracle](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and install it.
>  Windows users are recommend to opt for the 64-bit version of Java. If the download page does not explicitly state you are downloading the 64-bit version, you are likely downloading the 32-bit version.

3. Open the `.jar` file inside of the `bin` folder of the unzipped archive. This wizard will guide you through installing the correct version of Forge, the modloader used by Dragon Craft.
4. Navigate to your Minecraft game data folder. On Windows, the default location is `C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming` and can be opened by pressing the <kbd>Windows key</kbd> and <kbd>R</kbd> on your keyboard and entering `%appdata%\.minecraft` followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
5. Move all folders from your unzipped archive over to the Minecraft game data folder. Merge or replace if necessary.

7. Launch and enjoy!
