# Virtual Reality

## Playing Minecraft in VR

Get right inside the world of Minecraft with virtual reality. Build, explore and battle mobs — do all the things you know and love — but from a fresh perspective. With a VR headset on, coming face- to-face with monstrous mobs takes on new meaning; creeping into dark caves inspires even greater trepidation thanks to 3D audio; and the light of a gorgeous sunrise seems to envelop you more completely.

### For Java
Vivecraft is a mod for the Java Edition of Minecraft allowing you to play it in virtual reality with any SteamVR-compatible headset. For more information, [visit the Vivecraft website](http://www.vivecraft.org).

Currently, the Dragon Craft modpack does not contain Vivecraft by default, but we do officially support it. In order to use it with VR, install Vivecraft and afterwards install our modpack.

### For Bedrock
The Bedrock Edition of Minecraft officially support certain virtual reality headsets. For supported platforms, visit the [VR page on Minecraft's official site](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/vr). To learn more about how to use the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft in combination with Dragon Craft, [visit our Bedrock page](/dragoncraft/bedrock).

## VRChat Conversion Project
Invitees can add their creativity to this Minecraft world using creative mode. When the world is considered finished, it will be exported to VRChat so that everyone can enjoy and socialise in it in virtual reality.

Use the following address in your Minecraft client: `vr.craft.dragonprojects.net`.
